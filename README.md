# The Ubuntu Summit 2023 Review
Here I want to leave my review about the Developer Event "Ubuntu Summit 2023".


And after a while here we go! 
So yesterday was an awesome developers summit "Ubuntu Summit 2023" in my country Latvia, Riga.

It was an awesome three days which I found productive and useful.

I feel myself up-to-date.

I heard so much...

My favorite conferences were: "Asahi Linux in Macbook with M2 chip",
"WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux", 
"How to create a Flutter application for Linux",
a conference about "Framework" computers, and of course,
after the summit of the "Closing Party".

And what is so important, I had talked with them.

I never forget it.

And also, made new friends (From RTU, and had an idea to visit them the next week).

Thank you organization for the merch.

Had taken a swag bag and (more than 40) free stickers.


In my opinion, visited places like that when just a teen with a WINDOWS laptop in the bag :)

Thank you, The Open-Source Community!
