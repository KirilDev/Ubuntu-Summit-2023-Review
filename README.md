# ubuntuSummit2023Review
Here I want to leave my review about Developer Event "Ubuntu Summit 2023". P.S I promise that i start working with repos after it.


And after a while here we go! 
So yesterday was a awesome developers summit "Ubuntu Summit 2023" in my country Latvia, Riga.

It was awesome three days which i used productive and useful.

I fell myself up-to-date.

I heared so much...

My favorite confereces was is: "Asahi Linux in Macbook with M2 chip", "WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux", "How to create a flutter application for Linux", conference about "Framework" coputers and of course, "Closing Party".

And what is so much important, i had talked with them.

I never forget it.

And what is important, i made new friends (From RTU, had an idea to visit them on the next week).

Thank you organizators for the merch.

Had taken a swag bag and (more than 40) free stickers.


In my Opinion, visited place like than when just a teen with WINDOWS laptop in the bag :)

Thank you, Open-Source Community!
